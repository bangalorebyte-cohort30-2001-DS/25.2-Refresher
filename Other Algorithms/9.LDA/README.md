# LDA
Linear Discriminant Analysis 

- As a reference, read ISLR's section on LDA and QDA. Also refer to the LDA user guide here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html#lda-qda. Yes, LDA is also a dimensionality reduction technique, we will learn about that later. Dont worry about it now, if looking for youtube vidoes look only for LDA as a classification technique. 

- Go through the notebook to see an example of LDA and QDA implementaion. 

- For the in-class assignment, apply both LDA and QDA to the Banking dataset and see if it does better than logistic regression. LDA/QDA are though to do best for continous variables, (due to assumption of normal distribution). See how these models compare for the banking dataset. This https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-discriminant-analysis-for-machine-learning/ will also give you some perspective on which scenarios are better suited for Logistic regression and LDA.
